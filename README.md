## My process

1. Built HTML elements
2. Changed "container" background to light gray
3. Styled "card" element with a white grey background and a border radius for round edges

- Set a max-width
- Styled bottom box-shadow
- aligned "card" element using flex on "container"

4. Targeted the img element to be width: 100%

- Included a border radius for rounded edges

5. Applied font family changes
6. Added margin at the bottom of HTML elements for spacing

## Help!

1. In order to get the text to match with the example exactly, I used margin on the title and text classes to make the text appear more indented in line with the image above. I also needed to ad a <br> in the HTML before the word third last word. (See snippet below). Is there a better way to have achieved this?

2. Any points to make this code more effecient (besides colour variables)? I know it is probably too small of a project to add advice for this. Could I expect any formatting to be thrown out by adding css to classes that perhaps were not the best option to add them to?

3. Although I used flexbox.align-items property the space at the top of the page seems slightly larger than at the bottom. Is this just me?

SNIPPET FOR POINT 1. ABOVE.
